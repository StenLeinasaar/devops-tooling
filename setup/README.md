# Setup Tooling

This directory contains helper scripts for bootstrapping new infrastructure
projects.

## bootstrap_ansible.sh

Creates a minimal Ansible project layout. Provide a target directory as the
only argument and the script will create common folders and documentation
placeholders.

```bash
./bootstrap_ansible.sh my-ansible-project
```
